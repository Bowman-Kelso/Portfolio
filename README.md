## [🧑‍🤝‍🧑Multiplayer California Speed🧑‍🤝‍🧑](https://github.com/Bowman-Kelso/Portfolio/tree/main/CaliforniaSpeed)
This project allows users to play the card game known as California Speed. The objective is to claim matches before your opponent and be the first to zero cards in your draw pile. This project uses web sockets to facilitate real-time multiplayer between two players. Using a MongoDB connection, the game is also able to track wins and losses associated with each username.

## [🔠Hangman🔠](https://github.com/Bowman-Kelso/Portfolio/tree/main/Hangman)
This project allows users to play the popular word-guessing game, Hangman. To add some competition, user high scores are stored and displayed at the end of each game. This allows users to compete with each other. Custom graphics were created for each frame of the hangman's progression during the game and provide a visual indicator to the user of their status in the game.

## [💲Banking App💲](https://github.com/Bowman-Kelso/Portfolio/tree/main/BankingApp)
This project has all the basic functionality of a standard banking web app. Users are able to create accounts, deposit/withdraw money from 3 different accounts, transfer funds between the 3 accounts, and see a history of all actions taken on their account. Input validation ensures that users cannot enter invalid dollar amounts.

## [🔢Number Guesser🔢](https://github.com/Bowman-Kelso/Portfolio/tree/main/NumberGuesser)
This project allows users to play a simple number-guessing game. Users must enter a username before playing so that their score can be added to the high scores database. As they play, they receive feedback indicating whether their guess was too high or too low. Once they guess the correct number, the number of guesses made is recorded as their score. They are then taken to the high scores page to see how they compare to other players.
