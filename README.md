## Multiplayer California Speed
This project allows users to play the card game known as California Speed. The objective is to claim matches before your opponent and be the first to zero cards in your draw pile. This project uses web sockets to facilitate real-time multiplayer between two players. Using a MongoDB connection, the game is also able to track wins and losses associated with each username.
